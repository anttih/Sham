Sham - test stub and spy for PHP 5.3
====================================

Sham is test stub and spy (test double) for PHP 5.3 and up. The idea
behind Sham is to allow everything to be done to a Sham instance.
Sham records every interaction you have with it, you can then later
investigate what happened. It does not self-verify, use your testing
framework for asserting.

Sham is alpha quality, expect things to change.
